# Harness Governance

## User-only changes

Only a user decision may modify `spec.md` or `decisions.md`.

## Automatically mutable control-harness scope

A distinct Harness Maintainer may append evidence-backed knowledge, split
milestones, and repair control-harness mechanics. It must commit/push each
change, never edit deliverable source/tests, and never silently alter user
requirements.

## Interrupted work

- Resume meaningful dirty work on the exact current milestone branch.
- Preserve unrelated work with a named `git stash -u` plus durable handoff
  before branch/worktree repair.
- Never discard source work or force-push remote history.
