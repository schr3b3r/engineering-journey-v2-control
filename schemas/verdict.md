# Verdict Schema

Evaluator output must include exact lines:

```text
overall: PASS | FAIL
test_runner: PASS | FAIL
```

When a declared test runner exists, `overall: PASS` requires
`test_runner: PASS` plus all in-scope criteria passing. Include command,
count/output evidence, per-criterion result/method/notes, and a concise
summary. A test-runner permission failure is a FAIL/escalation, not a
substitute for manual code review.
