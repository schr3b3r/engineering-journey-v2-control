# Runbook: Engineering Journey v2

Operational how-to for running this project's control harness. See
`README.md` for the file-layout/boundaries overview and
`HARNESS_GOVERNANCE.md` for the governance rules this runbook operates
under.

## First-time setup

1. Fill `spec.md` from the approved `fulcra-prototype-grill-me`
   artifacts (`intake/brief.md`, `architecture.md`, `plan.md`) in the
   deliverable repo.
2. Break `plan.md`'s milestones into `coordinator/milestones.md` entries
   (scope, requirement IDs, done criteria, per milestone).
3. Choose and configure provider adapter commands for Generator and
   Evaluator (see README.md's "Provider adapters" section) --
   genuinely separate sessions/processes, not one session switching
   personas.
4. `./bootstrap.sh <team-name>` to provision the Fulcra Workspace team
   and print the durable paths it created.
5. `./doctor.sh` to confirm the harness is in a runnable state before
   the first real milestone run.

## Running one milestone

```bash
export HARNESS_GENERATOR_CMD='...'
export HARNESS_EVALUATOR_CMD='...'
python coordinator/run_milestone.py --milestone M1 --deliverable ../<deliverable-repo>
```

This will:
1. Create or resume the `milestone/M1-<slug>` branch in the deliverable
   repo.
2. Run Generator against that branch with `HARNESS_ROLE=generator` and
   the milestone's scope/context.
3. After Generator's first pushed commit, create or resume the PR.
4. Run Evaluator independently against the pushed branch state with
   `HARNESS_ROLE=evaluator`.
5. On `overall: PASS`, merge and update `milestone-progress.md` plus a
   concise `status-summary.md`.
6. On `overall: FAIL`, leave the branch/PR open and surface the verdict
   -- do not auto-retry past `coordinator/policy.md`'s bounded retry
   count without a process fix.

## Handling a decision request

If a role emits `decision_request: true` (per
`schemas/decision-request.md`), work pauses on that thread. Bring the
question to the user, record their raw answer in `decisions.md`
(append-only), then update `spec.md` if the decision changes formalized
requirements before resuming.

## Unattended/scheduled operation

See `coordinator/unattended-recovery.md` for the delayed-verifier
pattern and what it may/may not repair on its own.

## Resuming on a fresh machine

The control harness itself is portable (no execution history, no local
cache) -- clone this repo, re-run `./bootstrap.sh <team-name>` against
the same team name to reconnect to the existing Fulcra Workspace state,
then `./doctor.sh` before resuming milestone work.
